Hello and thank you for your time and attention.

I have developed in Fusebox 5.5 before but as one of several developers and I was not the appplication architect.

Currently I'm trying to set up an application in ColdFusion using Fusebox 5.5 (no XML.)   My purpose is setting up the architecture.  We want a working copy of a model Fusebox 5.5 application for other developers to follow.

The problem is that a query runs successfully inside the model template (crud4fusebox5_5/model/qry_SelTblTasks.cfm) but it isn't available to the view template (crud4fusebox5_5/view/display/dsp_landingPage.cfm)

I can successfully dump the qrySelTblTasks query in the model template but when I try to dump the qrySelTblTasks in the view template I get the error "Variable QRYSELTBLTASKS is undefined."

Both templates are included in a single fuseaction (the query before the dsiplay) so as I understand it the variable in the model should be available to the view.

I read the available ColdFusion 5.5 on-line documentation as well as _Fusebox 5 & Flip_ and _How to Drive Fusebox 5.5_.  Also I googled "ColdFusion Variable is undefined" and "Fusebox Variable is undefined." But I couldn't identify a solution.

Please advise.

TIA.
